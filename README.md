abadonns-emacs
==============

This is not really a project but merely an attempt to unify all my emacs settings.
I would like to create a personal tool suitable for my development but hopefully it can help others too. 
My main dev languages are PHP and Python with bits of HTML, CSS and JS so I would like to focus on features supproting their syntax.

General settings 
- using 2 spaces for indentation. No one likes TABs so there's no reason for me to use them either.
